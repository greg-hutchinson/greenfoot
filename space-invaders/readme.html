<h1>SpaceInvaders Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Setting up our World</h2>
<p>Open Greenfoot and double-click on MyWorld.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now in the editor, everywhere that there is the word MyWorld replace it with
SpaceInvadersWorld. (Note the capitalization). Change the size to 1024 by 800.
// super(1024, 800, 1);</li>
<li>Lets set a nice space type background as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reminder - Animation</h2>
<p>Remember that animation is achieved by placing an object at an x, y location on the screen. Everytime the screen is redrawn if that x and/or y coordinate has changed the object will appear as if it had moved there. This can be thought of much like movie frames in film.</p>
<h2>Understanding Objects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assume we have a class of Person. Each person can know their name, age, and team that they belong to. They might also know how to do the following:
sit(), stand(), moveForward(someNumberOfSteps) //More on functions later</li>
<li>Let's look at this on Miro
https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO6NNQBE=/?moveToWidget=3458764526885156301&amp;cot=14</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding Actors</h2>
<p>Actors are the basic building blocks within Greenfoot.
Explore how to create an Actor (Rocket)</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the icon</li>
<li>Now we will use the Greenfoot environment to look at some of the methods
inherited from Actor</li>
<li>turn(), getRotation(), getX(), getY(), act()</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all Actors will have an act() method. This is where all (most) of your programming will occur.</p>
<h2>How to know what methods that Actors can respond to.</h2>
<p>From your <strong>main screen</strong> in the Greenfoot environment, select Help then Greenfoot Class Documentation.</p>
<h2>How To Do User Input</h2>
<p>There is another class in the Greenfoot environment named - well - <strong>Greenfoot</strong>. This class provides some useful functions for communicating with the player of the game. One of these methods is the <strong>isKeyDown</strong> method.</p>
<p>So, after we understand how this method works, we can now make our act method look like this.  We haven't discussed the <strong>if</strong> statement yet, but for now, I think you will get the idea.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">    public void act()
    {
        if (Greenfoot.isKeyDown(&quot;left&quot;)) {
            move (-5);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>That works great - our Rocket now moves to the left. Enhance the code so that the Rocket will also move to the right.</p>
<h2>Understanding Variables in Java</h2>
<p>Variables are things that can hold on to values that might change over the course of your program. Variables can be thought of as labelled &quot;pockets&quot; or &quot;boxes&quot; to hold things until you later want to retrieve the things or change the things. When we <strong>declare</strong> a variable we must also declare what <strong>type</strong> of object this variable is going to hold on to. For example, if I want a variable to hold on to the current x coordinate of something I might declare it like this.</p>
<pre><code>int x;
</code></pre>
<p>This says that x is a variable (named box) that can hold onto any integer value. (Integers are whole numbers - positive or negative).</p>
<p>Remember that any time you declare a variable you always declare the type first. So the general form for declaring variables is</p>
<p><strong>someType</strong> <strong>variableName</strong></p>
<p>where some common <strong>someTypes</strong> are int, String, Object, or Rocket.</p>
<p>And remember to think of it as a named box where a value can be put in or taken out.</p>
<pre><code>  +-----------+
x |   300     |
  +-----------+
</code></pre>
<p>The way that we put things into the box is by assigning a value to the box. (i.e the value 300 was put into the above box by the following code)</p>
<pre><code>x = 300;    //Note the semicolon at the end;
</code></pre>
<p>and the way that we get values out of the box later is by refering to the box name.</p>
<pre><code>y = x + 1; 
</code></pre>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:
When there is an &quot;=&quot; sign you need to think of it as an assignment operation not as a mathematical equality sign so the above should be said as
&quot;Take whatever is in box x, add 1 to it and put it in box y&quot;</p>
<p>This would result in the following:</p>
<pre><code>  +-----------+
x |   300     |
  +-----------+

  +-----------+
y |   301     |
  +-----------+
</code></pre>
<p>Variables must be defined within the class you are working in.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">    public class YourClass extends Actor
    {
        //Variables must be defined here before the act method.
        //This is not always true, but for now - just trust me. :-)

        int numberOfPixels = 5;

        public void act() {
    	     move(5);   // hard-coded 5
             // is the same as ...
             move(numberOfPixels);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<h3>First Exercise - Create some objects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create an Alien subclass (from Actor)
<ul>
<li>set the icon</li>
<li>make your Actor move across the screen from left to right 5 pixels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a Rocket subclass (from Actor)
<ul>
<li>set the icon</li>
<li>make your Actor move across the screen from right to left 8 pixels</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have the above working, change the numbers in your move statement to use a variable of type int.</p>
<h2>Understanding the if statement</h2>
<h1>The “If” statement</h1>
<p>The if statement must occur within your act() method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">    ...
    if ( someBooleanExpression ) {
        statement1;
        statement2;
            ...
        statementN;
    }
    else {
        elseStatement1;
        elseStatement2;
            ...
        elseStatementN;
      }
   }
</code></pre>
<p>Let's break that down - firstly what is someBooleanExpression. It is an expression that after it is evaluate results in a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; value.  For example</p>
<pre><code>4 &lt;= 6;  // this results in a &quot;true&quot; value
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>int y = 10;
y &lt;= 6;  // this results in a &quot;false&quot; value.
</code></pre>
<p>or say that getX() is a function that currently returns 1 (If the Actor
was against the left side of the screen) then</p>
<pre><code>getX() &lt;= 1    //this results in a &quot;true&quot; value.
</code></pre>
<p>Combining this we now have a valid &quot;if&quot; statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">if (getX() &lt;= 1) {
    // Do something that makes sense here
    // Like ... Let's bounce 
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-Java">    public void act()
    {
        int currentX = getX();
        int newX = currentX + x;
        if (newX &lt;= 1) {
            x = -x;
        }
        if (newX &gt;= getWorld().getWidth() - 1) {
            x = -x;
        }
        setLocation(newX, currentY);
    }


</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-Java">    public void act()
    {
        int currentX = getX();
        int newX = currentX + x;
        int currentY = getY();
        if (newX &lt;= 1) {
            x = -x;
            currentY = getY() + 30; //
        }
        if (newX &gt;= getWorld().getWidth() - 1) {
            x = -x;
            currentY = getY() + 30;
        }
        setLocation(newX, currentY);
    }
</code></pre>
<h2>Collision Detection.</h2>
<pre><code class="language-Java">        Bullet bullet = (Bullet) getOneIntersectingObject(Bullet.class);
        if (bullet != null) {
            SpaceInvadersWorld world = getWorldOfType(SpaceInvadersWorld.class);
            world.addScore(10);
            world.removeObject(bullet);
            world.removeObject(this);
        }

</code></pre>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Notice the difference in Functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an Alien</li>
</ul>
<h2>Explain Object relationships</h2>
<h2>Understanding the Environment</h2>
<h2>Understanding Java</h2>
<p>The first thing that we want to get working is to add some Aliens to our World that allows them to March across the screen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Class Crab</li>
<li>Give it an appropriate Icon</li>
<li>Make it move left to right on the screen. This should look funny because the crab is facing the wrong direction. How are we going to fix that?</li>
<li>Now when the crab gets to the border of the screen he should bounce. (go the other sideways direction)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some useful Snippets of Code.
Whenever you need to get information to or from the SpaceInvadersWorld you need to do it with this line of code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">    SpaceInvadersWorld world = getWorldOfType(SpaceInvadersWorld.class);
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can invoke methods that exist within your SpaceInvadersWorld class like such</p>
<pre><code class="language-Java">    SpaceInvadersWorld world = getWorldOfType(SpaceInvadersWorld.class);
    int width = world.getWidth();
</code></pre>
