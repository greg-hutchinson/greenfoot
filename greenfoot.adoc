*SpaceInvaders Tutorial*

*Setting up our World*

Open Greenfoot and double-click on MyWorld. - Now in the editor,
everywhere that there is the word MyWorld replace it with
SpaceInvadersWorld. (Note the capitalization). - Change the size to 1024
by 800. // super(1024, 800, 1); - Lets set a nice space type background
as well.

*Saving our Work and adding some icons and sounds*

• Take note of the directory where your work will be saved. When you do
a save as … You should get a dialog that tells you where everything is
currently being saved to. Write it down for later. However, don’t
complete the save As … - just do a save for now.

*Reminder - Animation*

Remember that animation is achieved by placing an object at an x, y
location on the screen. Everytime the screen is redrawn if that x and/or
y coordinate has changed the object will appear as if it had moved
there. This can be thought of much like movie frames in film.

*Understanding Objects*

• Assume we have a class of Person. Each person can know their name, +
age, and team that they belong to. They might also know how to do the +
following: sit(), stand(), moveForward(someNumberOfSteps) //More on +
functions later +

*Understanding Actors*

Actors are the basic building blocks within Greenfoot. Explore how to
create an Actor (Rocket) - Set the icon - Now we will use the Greenfoot
environment to look at some of the methods inherited from Actor -
turn(), getRotation(), getX(), getY(), act()

Note that all Actors will have an act() method. This is where all (most)
of your programming will occur.

*How to know what methods that Actors can respond to.*

From your *main screen* in the Greenfoot environment, select Help then
Greenfoot Class Documentation.

*How To Do User Input*

There is another class in the Greenfoot environment named - well -
*Greenfoot*. This class provides some useful functions for communicating
with the player of the game. One of these methods is the *isKeyDown*
method.

So, after we understand how this method works, we can now make our act
method look like this. We haven’t discussed the *if* statement yet, but
for now, I think you will get the idea.

*public* void act() +
\{ +
*if* (Greenfoot.isKeyDown("left")) \{ +
move (-5); +
} +
}

That works great - our Rocket now moves to the left. Enhance the code so
that the Rocket will also move to the right.

*First Exercise - Create some objects*

• Create a Rocket subclass (from Actor) +
*–* set the icon +
*–* make your Actor move across the screen from right to left 8 pixels
when the left or right arrow keys are pressed.

*Our first Bug…*

It seems that our Rocket is facing the wrong direction. Actually, this
is the right direction as by default all objects are to be facing east
(0 degrees) but I digress. To fix this bug we need to figure out a
different strategy. Well, luckily we know that we can turn our object by
any number of degrees or we can set it’s rotation (setRotation()) but we
only need to do this once - not everytime the Rocket is asked to act().
As it turns out, all actors are also sent a special method call
addToWorld(World world) once (and only once) whenever they are added to
the world. This is convenient to do some one time initialization. Let’s
see how this works.

*public* void addedToWorld(World world) \{ +
setRotation(270); +
}

Note: This must come after the act() method (After the last *}* in *act*
) but before the last *}* in the class Rocket.

This method is called by the Greenfoot system only if it exists in the
class and again, it is only called once.

This has solved one problem for us, but has now introduced a problem
with the way we move.

*A different way to move*

We have a problem - we want our Rocket to move east or west but it is
facing north. Now we have to think about the coordinate system. Assume
that the rocket is sitting somewhere near the bottom of the screen at
let say 200, 800 (x = 200, y = 800). If the left arrow key is pushed, we
would like the rocket to be at a new location of x = 192, y = 800. Of
course, if the right arrow key had been pushed we would have expected
the Rocket to be at x = 208, y = 800 and if the right arrow key was
pushed again then the Rocket would be at x = 216, y = 800 and so on.
Notice the y coordinate does not change because we only want the rocket
to move left or right not up and down. So let’s see how this might be in
code.

*public* void act() +
\{ +
int currentX; +
int newX; +
int newY; +
currentX = getX(); +
newX = getX(); _// Assume the new x will be the same as the old_ *if*
(Greenfoot.isKeyDown("left")) \{ +
newX = currentX - 8; _//We need to change_ +
} +
*if* (Greenfoot.isKeyDown("right")) \{ +
newX = currentX + 8; +
} +
newY = getY(); _// The y position will not change_ +
setLocation(newX, newY);

}

Let’s picture this in memory

*Exercise*

• Make the changes to your Rocket class.

• Create a new class Alien.

• Make your Alien move across the screen from right to left by 3 pixels
or so.

*Understanding Variables in Java*

Variables are things that can hold on to values that might change over
the course of your program. Variables can be thought of as labelled
“pockets” or “boxes”to hold things until you later want to retrieve the
things or change the things. When we *declare* a variable we must also
declare what *type* of object this variable is going to hold on to. For
example, if I want a variable to hold on to the current x coordinate of
something I might declare it like this.

int x;

This says that x is a variable (named box) that can hold onto any
integer value. (Integers are whole numbers - positive or negative).

Remember that any time you declare a variable you always declare the
type first. So the general form for declaring variables is

*someType variableName*

where some common *someTypes* are int, String, Object, or Rocket.

And remember to think of it as a named box where a value can be put in
or taken out.

+-----------+ +
x | 300 | +
+-----------+

The way that we put things into the box is by assigning a value to the
box. (i.e the value 300 was put into the above box by the following
code)

x = 300; //Note the semicolon at the end;

and the way that we get values out of the box later is by refering to
the box name.

y = x + 1;

IMPORTANT NOTE: When there is an “=” sign you need to think of it as an
assignment operation not as a mathematical equality sign so the above
should be said as “Take whatever is in box x, add 1 to it and put it in
box y”

This would result in the following:

+-----------+ +
x | 300 |
____

____
+-----------+

+-----------+ +
y | 301 | +
+-----------+

Variables must be defined within the class you are working in.

*public class* YourClass *extends* Actor +
\{ +
_//Variables must be defined here before the act method._ _//This is not
always true, but for now - just trust me. :-)_

int numberOfPixels = 5;
____

}

____
*public* void act() \{ +
move(5); _// hard-coded 5_ +
_// is the same as ..._

move(numberOfPixels); +
}

*Understanding the if statement*

*The “If” statement*

The if statement must occur within your act() method.

*...*

*if* ( someBooleanExpression ) +
\{ +
statement1; +
statement2; +
*...*

statementN; +
} +
*else* +
\{ +
elseStatement1; +
elseStatement2; +
*...*

elseStatementN; +
} +
}

Let’s break that down - firstly what is someBooleanExpression. It is an
expression that after it is evaluate results in a “true” or “false”
value. For example
____

5

____
4 <= 6; // this results in a "true" value

or

int y = 10; +
y <= 6; // this results in a "false" value.

or say that getX() is a function that currently returns 1 (If the Actor
was against the left side of the screen) then

getX() <= 1 //this results in a "true" value.

Combining this we now have a valid “if” statement

*if* (getX() <= 1) \{ +
_// Do something that makes sense here_ +
_// Like ... Let's bounce_ +
}

*public* void act() +
\{ +
int currentX = getX(); +
int newX = currentX + x; +
*if* (newX <= 1) \{ +
x = -x; +
} +
*if* (newX >= getWorld().getWidth() - 1) \{ +
x = -x; +
} +
setLocation(newX, currentY); +
}

The above snippet should help you modify your Alien class so that it
bounces. Make the above changes to your Alien class. Once you have that
working, think about the following: How would you make the Aliens move
down the screen (when they get to one side or the other) closer and
closer to the Rocket until they crash into the Rocket??

If you think that you know how to do that, please try on your own.

*public* void act() +
\{ +
int currentX = getX(); +
int newX = currentX + x; +
int currentY = getY(); +
*if* (newX <= 1) \{ +
x = -x; +
currentY = getY() + 30; _//_ +
} +
*if* (newX >= getWorld().getWidth() - 1) \{ +
x = -x;

currentY = getY() + 30; +
} +
setLocation(newX, currentY);

*The Bullet Class*

For now we have enough to create a Bullet class. - Assign it an
appropriate icon (Use one of the small ball classes for now. We can
tweak icons later.) - By default it should also have its rotation facing
north. (up) - When it is on the screen it should move with velocity of
10. - If it hits the top of the screen it should be gone. To remove an
object from the screen is to remove it from the world and that looks
like this:

SpaceInvadersWorld world = getWorldOfType(SpaceInvadersWorld.class);
world.removeObject (*this*);
____

Hint: removing objects from the world has to be the last thing in an act
method.

____
Now drop this Bullet on the screen and test that it behaves as expected.
We will get it to fire from the rocket in the next section. However,
notice that this class is a little different from all the other classes
because it doesn’t already exist on the screen from the first moment.
Normally, this would be created on the fly - (I.e - when someone hits
the space bar)

*Dynamic Object Creation*

Now that we have all the behaviour working in the bullet class it would
be nice if we could hit the space bar to fire a bullet (or missile or
phaser). To create a Bullet on the fly, we need a snippet of code that
looks like this:

Bullet bullet = *new* Bullet(); +
getWorld().addObject(bullet,???, ???); _//Where (x,y) should it be
added?_

Well we know that the x coordiant will be the same as the x coordinate
of the Rocket and the y coordinate (slightly modified) will be as well.
So this following snippet might do the trick.

Bullet bullet = *new* Bullet(); +
getWorld().addObject(bullet,getX(), getY() - 10);
____

*Exercise - Add the dynamic creation of the Bullet to the Rocket class*

____
Hints: - you know how to do if statements - you know how to get keyboard
input.

Problems: It looks like a lot of bullets are being fired. There should
only be one. You will have to import Java.util.List below.
____

____
List <Bullet> bullets = getWorld().getObjects(Bullet.class); *if*
(bullets.isEmpty()) +
\{ +
*if* (Greenfoot.isKeyDown("space")) +
\{ +
Bullet bullet = *new* Bullet(); +
getWorld().addObject(bullet,getX(), getY() - 10 ; } +
}

*Collision Detection.*

Now all that we need to know is whether the Alien is hit by a bullet.
This is called collision detection and the way that this works is by
asking the Actor whether there is one intersecting object currently
touching the Actor (Alien). If there is, that object will be returned in
a variable otherwise *null* will be returned.

So within the Alien class, in the act method after everything else (but
still in the act method) add these lines of code.

Bullet bullet = (Bullet) getOneIntersectingObject(Bullet.class); +
*if* (bullet != *null*) +
\{ +
SpaceInvadersWorld world = getWorldOfType(SpaceInvadersWorld.class); _//
world.addScore(10);_ +
world.removeObject(bullet); +
world.removeObject(*this*); +
}

*Adding Scores*

• Import the Label class

*Adding more Aliens - Understanding for loops*

*Some useful Snippets of Code.*

*Getting the World*

Whenever you need to get information to or from the SpaceInvadersWorld
you need to do it with this line of code.

SpaceInvadersWorld world = getWorldOfType(SpaceInvadersWorld.class);

Now you can invoke methods that exist within your SpaceInvadersWorld
class like such
____

____
SpaceInvadersWorld world = getWorldOfType(SpaceInvadersWorld.class); int
width = world.getWidth();

*Printing to the console.*

System.out.println ("The value of x is" + getX()");
